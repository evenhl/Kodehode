    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
    <p><pre class="preformatted">
        400 g tagliatelle, pappardelle, or other ribbon pasta 
        1 liter water
        0.5 dl salt
        4 chicken breasts 
        1 tsp salt
        1 tsp freshly ground pepper
        1 tbsp neutral oil or butter
        200 g parmesan 
    </pre></p>

    <h2 class="heading">Instructions</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"><pre>
        1.Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water.
            If you're using dried pasta, cook until there are 2-3 minutes left on the package cooking time. 
            For fresh pasta, cook for just 30 seconds to 1 minute. The pasta shouldn’t be fully cooked as it will continue to cook in the sauce.
        2.Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.  
        3.Cook the chicken: Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat with oil, butter, or a combination of both.
            When the butter stops foaming, add the chicken breasts. Sear each side for about 2 minutes to get a nice crust.
            Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil, reduce the heat to low, and cook for an additional 4-6 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken. 
        4.Rest the chicken: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes so the juices don’t immediately run out when you start slicing it.
        5.Make the sauce: Use the same pan for the sauce. Add butter to the pan and let it melt over medium heat. 
            Add a couple of tablespoons of pasta water to the pan and let it simmer for about 1 minute.
        6. Combine pasta and sauce: Add the pasta to the pan, along with a ladle of hot pasta water, and stir until the water is absorbed.
            Keep adding pasta water until the pasta reaches an "al dente" texture. Fold in parmesan cheese and let it melt into the pasta.
            Add a bit more pasta water if needed to create a creamy sauce that clings to the pasta.
            Slice the chicken and serve immediately with some chopped parsley, pepper, and extra parmesan if desired.
